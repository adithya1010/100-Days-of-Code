## 100 Days of Code🐍🔥 - Adithya S.T.
This Github Repo contains the code for the 100 days of code challenge that I did by following the course by [London App Brewery🍺](https://www.londonappbrewery.com/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

As of writing this Readme I'm on Day-18 and I'm not able to quite stick to the "100 Days pledge" as I'm in my final year in the completion of my degree and I'm undergoing placement training as well as attending interviews🥵...

Anyways so this is a not so "100" of code challenge but hey I'm here for the journey anyways🧗.

This Readme will serve as a Progress Tracker 🛤️ as well as a Journal📗 in my Journey.

I also regularly post my progress over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adithya_st) so check that out to👍

Also providing the link to my notes over on:  [Notion](https://adithya1010.notion.site/100-Days-of-Code-504b2b4887434c2c802e5c6a97002d62)
