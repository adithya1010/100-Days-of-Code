## 100 Days of Code🐍🔥 - Adithya S.T.
This Github Repo contains the code for the 100 days of code challenge that I did by following the course by [London App Brewery🍺](https://www.londonappbrewery.com/) on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

As of writing this Readme I'm on Day-18 and I'm not able to quite stick to the "100 Days pledge" as I'm in my final year in the completion of my degree and I'm undergoing placement training as well as attending interviews🥵...

Anyways so this is a not so "100" of code challenge but hey I'm here for the journey anyways🧗.

This Readme will serve as a Progress Tracker 🛤️ as well as a Journal📗 in my Journey.

I also regularly post my progress over on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adithya_st) so check that out to👍

Also providing the link to my notes over on:  [Notion](https://adithya1010.notion.site/100-Days-of-Code-504b2b4887434c2c802e5c6a97002d62)

<strong>Day-23-16th August,2022</strong><br>
<strong>Turtle Crossing Game 🐢🛣️🚗:</strong><br>
Difficulty level chosen: <strong>Hard🔥</strong><br>
<strong>Plan📝:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A turtle moves forwards when you press the “Up” Key. It can only move forwards not back, left or right</li>
<li>Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge</li>
<li>When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the original position and the player levels up. On the next level,the car speed increases</li>
<li>When the turtle collides with a car it’s game over and everything up<br>
<strong>Done list ⛏️:</strong><br>
✅Create a turtle player that starts at the bottom of the screen and listen for the “Up” key press to move the turtle north.<br>
✅Create cars that are 20px high by 40px wide that are randomly generated along the y-axis and move to the left edge of the screen. No cars should be generated in the top and bottom 50px of the screen<br>
✅Detect when the turtle player has reached the top edge of the screen (i.e., reached the FINISH_LINE_Y). When this happens, return the turtle to the starting position and increase the speed of the cars. Hint: think about creating an attribute and using the MOVE_INCREMENT to increase the car speed<br>
